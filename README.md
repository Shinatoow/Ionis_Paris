### Setup your pybstick
(I assume that you have a Pybstick with a storage associated to it (like a micro sd) 
1 - Download the main.py from this repository
2 - Plug the pybstick 
3 - Drag and drop the file (main.py) to usb lector (D: or E:)
4 - Your Pybstick is ready to use

### Use you pybstick
1 - Plug your pybstick to a power charge (it could be your computer or an external battery)
2 - A red light and a green light should be lighting, if you have only a red unplug and re-plug until you have both light
3 - Press the button above both light for less than 2 seconds
4 - The two light would go off
5 - After that all led would be lit, your pysbtick is collecting data !
6 - To stop your data capturing you should hold press the button you have pressed at the step 3 when two of the four light are off
6+ (you can hold for 5 secondes the button to end your capture)
7 - when all led are off you can remove safely the pybstick from your power source


### retrieve your data
1 - Plug your pysbtick to a computer (if you have have used the same computer for the measurement, unplug and plug back your pybstick or your data won't be visible)
2 - go to the data folder of your pybstick
3 - You should have a file named "measurexx.csv"
4 - Open this file (I recommend Excel for that) and here is your data !! :D
