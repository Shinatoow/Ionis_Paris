### Setup your pybstick <br />
(I assume that you have a Pybstick with a storage associated to it (like a micro sd) <br />
1 - Download the main.py from this repository <br />
2 - Plug the pybstick <br />
3 - Drag and drop the file (main.py) to usb lector (D: or E:) <br />
4 - Create a folder name "data"
5 - Your Pybstick is ready to use <br />

### Use you pybstick <br />
1 - Plug your pybstick to a power charge (it could be your computer or an external battery) <br />
2 - A red light and a green light should be lighting, if you have only a red unplug and re-plug until you have both light <br />
3 - Press the button above both light for less than 2 seconds <br />
4 - The two light would go off <br />
5 - After that all led would be lit, your pysbtick is collecting data !<br />
6 - To stop your data capturing you should hold press the button you have pressed at the step 3 when two of the four light are off <br />
6+ (you can hold for 5 secondes the button to end your capture) <br />
7 - when all led are off you can remove safely the pybstick from your power source <br />
<br />

### retrieve your data <br />
1 - Plug your pysbtick to a computer (if you have have used the same computer for the measurement, unplug and plug back your pybstick or your data won't be visible)<br />
2 - go to the data folder of your pybstick <br />
3 - You should have a file named "measurexx.csv" <br />
4 - Open this file (I recommend Excel for that) and here is your data !! :D <br />
